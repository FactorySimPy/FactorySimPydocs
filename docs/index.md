### ReservablePriorityReqStore   



The ReservablePriorityReqStore is a class derived from SimPy's Store class that addresses a missing capability in the library by allowing both priority-based retrieval and reservation of items(or space) before they are actually retrieved (or put), respecting the capacity of the store. This is particularly useful in manufacturing systems where materials or products must be allocated in advance, ensuring that specific parts are reserved for machines before processing begins. It also allows priority-based retrieval, ensuring that urgent requests are handled first. Additionally, decoupling reservation from yielding a "get" request ensures that items remain in storage until they are actually needed, improving coordination in assembly lines and buffer management. Unlike SimPy’s existing resource reservation methods, which manage process-related elements like machines or operators, ReservablePriorityReqStore focuses on item-level management, making it a valuable addition for handling inventory, buffer stocks, and material flows in discrete-event simulations.
However, when implementhing SimPy interrupts, the events should be manually cancelled incase of an interruption.


 

The `ReservablePriorityReqStore` extends SimPy's `Store` by allowing users to:  

- **Reserve Capacity**: Processes can reserve space (or item) in the store before actual put (or get) in it.  

- **Enforce Reservation Rules**: Prohibits any process from adding (or getting) items to the store without a prior reservation.  

- **Priority for requests**: Users can pass a priority along with the reservation requests. The requests with the highest priority(lowest first) will be yielded first. Two requests with same priority will be yielded in a FIFO manner.

- **Cancel a reservation**: Allows users to cancel a placed/yielded reserve_put (or reserve_get) request.




##### Parameters
- **`env`**: The SimPy environment managing the simulation.  
- **`capacity`**: Maximum number of items the store can hold (default: infinite).  

##### Example Usage 
```python
import simpy
import random
from ReservablePriorityReqStore import ReservablePriorityReqStore

class Item:
    """Represents an item to be stored."""
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

# Simulation Setup
env = simpy.Environment()
itemstore = ReservablePriorityReqStore(env, capacity=3)

def producer(env, itemstore, name, priority):
    """Producer process produces items and puts it in the store."""
    yield env.timeout(random.uniform(1, 3))  # Simulate time before producing

    put_reservation = itemstore.reserve_put(priority=priority)
    yield put_reservation  # Wait for reservation to succeed

    item = Item(f"{name}")
    itemstore.put(put_reservation, item)
    print(f"T={env.now:.2f} : {name} added to store with priority {priority}")

def consumer(env, itemstore, name, priority, cancel=False):
    """Consumer process picks up items from the store."""
   
    get_reservation = itemstore.reserve_get(priority=priority)
    print(f"T={env.now:.2f} : {name} placed a reserve_get request 
             to store with priority {priority}")

    if cancel and random.choice([True, False]):
        itemstore.reserve_get_cancel(get_reservation)
        print(f"T={env.now:.2f} : {name} CANCELED reservation")
        return

    yield get_reservation  # Wait for reservation to succeed
    print(f"T={env.now:.2f} : {name} yielded from store with priority {priority}")
    yield env.timeout(random.uniform(2, 5))
    item = itemstore.get(get_reservation)
    print(f"T={env.now:.2f} : {name} retrieved {item.name} from store with 
                priority {priority}")

# Creating producers and consumers
env.process(consumer(env, itemstore, "Consumer1", priority=3, cancel=True))
env.process(consumer(env, itemstore, "Consumer2", priority=1))
env.process(consumer(env, itemstore, "Consumer3", priority=2))


env.process(producer(env, itemstore, "ItemA", priority=2))
env.process(producer(env, itemstore, "ItemB", priority=1))
env.process(producer(env, itemstore, "ItemC", priority=3))


env.run(until=10)
```

**Simulation output**  
```
T=0.00 : Consumer1 placed a reserve_get request to store with priority 3
T=0.00 : Consumer1 CANCELED reservation
T=0.00 : Consumer2 placed a reserve_get request to store with priority 1
T=0.00 : Consumer3 placed a reserve_get request to store with priority 2

##### Usecase
```python
# @title Usecase
import simpy
from ReservablePriorityReqStore import ReservablePriorityReqStore

'''
In this simulation, two machines (MachineGreen and MachineOrange) produce
new items by consuming specific part. MachineGreen,which produces green balls, 
requests parts (like yellow and blue balls) with a higher priority, while 
MachineOrange, which produces orange balls, requests parts
(like yellow and red balls) with lower priority. Producers generate red, yellow, 
and blue balls at defined intervals, and consumers retrieve the assembled green 
and orange balls from their respective stores.'''

## PriorityReqStore

PriorityReqStore is a resource store with priority handling capabilities. Users can add a priority for each of the get(or put) requests. Request with lower values of priority yields first among all get(or put) requests. If two requests with same priority are placed from two processes then FIFO order is followed to yield the requests.

**Main Features:**

- **Priority for requests**: Manages concurrent requests with different priority values.


##### Parameters  
- **`env`**: The SimPy environment managing the simulation.  
- **`capacity`**: Maximum number of items the store can hold (default: infinite).  



### Example Usage
```python
import simpy
from PriorityReqStore import PriorityReqStore

class item:
  def __init__(self,name):
    self.name=name

def source(name,env,delay,priority=0):
    i=1

    yield env.timeout(delay)
    item1 = item(name='item'+str(name)+str(i))
    print(f'T={env.now:.2f}: Source {name} Going to put an item in 
                    store {item1.name} with priority {priority}')

    yield store.put(item1,priority)
    i+=2
def sink(name,env,delay,priority):

    yield env.timeout(delay)
    print(f'T={env.now:.2f}: Sink {name} placed a get request with 
                     priority {priority} in the store')
    item = yield store.get(priority)
    print(f'T={env.now:.2f}: Sink {name} Got an item from store {item.name}')



env= simpy.Environment()
store= PriorityReqStore(env,2)

p1= env.process(sink('OUT-1',env,0,2))
p2= env.process(sink('OUT-2',env,0,1))
p3= env.process(source('IN-A',env,1,2))
p4= env.process(source('IN-B',env,1,1))

env.run(until=5)
```

**Simulation output** 
```
T=0.00: Sink OUT-1 placed a get request with priority 2 in the store
T=0.00: Sink OUT-2 placed a get request with priority 1 in the store
T=1.00: Source IN-A Going to put an item in store itemIN-A1 with priority 2
T=1.00: Source IN-B Going to put an item in store itemIN-B1 with priority 1
T=1.00: Sink OUT-2 Got an item from store itemIN-A1
T=1.00: Sink OUT-1 Got an item from store itemIN-B1
```
